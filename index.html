		<h2 >The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a species of humpback dolphin inhabiting coastal waters of the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans. This species is often referred to as the Chinese white dolphin in mainland China, Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore as a common name. <br>
			印度太平洋驼背海豚（学名：Sousa chinensis），中文通称为中华白海豚，又称太平洋驼海豚、中华驼海豚、粉红海豚等，台湾俗称为妈祖鱼，是一种背鳍基部隆起的海豚科动物（有地域差异），广泛分布于西太平洋和东印度洋的热带及温带沿岸海域，偶尔出现在淡水中，如长江、闽江、九龙江和珠江等。

			An adult Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is grey, white or pink and may appear as an albino dolphin to some. Populations along the coasts of China and Thailand have been observed with pink skin. The pink colour originates not from a pigment, but from blood vessels which were overdeveloped for thermoregulation. <br>
			肤色因地域、种群而异，多呈灰白相间的杂色，且带有深色斑点。模式标本产自中国水域，中国的种群初生时全身呈深灰色，随着年龄增长淡化为独特的粉白色，颇具观赏价值，有学者认为这是一种遇热反应(如同人类在燥热时会脸红）。</h2>

			The Cantonese language has a slang expression Wu Gei Bak Gei (meaning "black taboo white taboo") which refers that someone or something is a bad omen or a nuisance. The phrase originates from the Cantonese fisher people, because they claim the dolphins eat the fish in their nets. In formal Chinese, the Gei was originally written in old Chinese, meaning dolphins. The Wu refers to the finless porpoises, which are black, and the Bak, white, referring to Chinese river dolphins. These two species often interrupt and ruin the fishermen's catch. As years passed, because Gei,"dolphin", sounds the same as "bad luck", the meaning of the phrase changed. However, in Cantonese, wu refers to the calves of Chinese white dolphin and bak refers to the adults. Nowadays, dolphins are not called Gei anymore, but Hai Tun, literally meaning "sea pig", with none of the negative connotations for pig found in English.<br>

			广东俗语“乌忌白忌”表示坏的预兆，“乌”指中华白海豚的幼崽，“白”则指成年中华白海豚。该俗语起源于广东渔民，他们声称中华白海豚会吃他们渔网中的鱼获。然而一般的中文语境里，多将该俗语写为“乌鱀白𬶨”（“𬶨”为白𬶨豚的古称），“乌”指深灰色的长江江豚，“白”则指浅灰色的白𬶨豚，这两种鲸类过去常被指破坏鱼获。
